This is my folder for the Histopathologic Cancer Detection Competition on Kaggle. Here is a link to the competition on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview 

Here is a link to the webpage where you can find the data: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data. I have the test and training data downloaded locally but it's way too large to push to github so I didn't include it here
